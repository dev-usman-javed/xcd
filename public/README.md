# Image Folder

Place your image file here for the New Year wish page.

**For Vercel deployment:**
- Place your image in this `/public` folder
- Reference it in your code with a path starting with `/` (e.g., `/your-image.jpg`)
- The public folder is served at the root, so `/your-image.jpg` will work

**Example:**
- If you place `couple-photo.jpg` in this folder
- Use `/couple-photo.jpg` as the src in App.jsx
